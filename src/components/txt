Alright, here’s the **clean, structured extraction of *all visible text*** from the image.
No fluff. No guessing. If something isn’t readable, I won’t hallucinate it.

### Quick critique (since you expect honesty 😏):

* Text hierarchy is solid, but **paragraphs are too long** for modern web UX. Break them.
* Repetitive phrasing: *“commitment”, “crafted”, “ensures”* — safe corporate words, zero personality.
* Labels like **“Nature oriented”** → grammatically weak. Use **“Nature-Oriented Design”** or **“Nature-First Living”**.

If you want:

* JSON / CMS-ready format
* Headline rewrites (less boring, more premium)
* UX-optimized shorter copy

Say the word.
